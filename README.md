It's a game that Ä± created with java with no game engine. It's based on a internet character which known as Bilge Adam Reis. I have worked on a project with the aim of humor and learning Java mechanics, it's a demo of it. I don't have any plan to finish it soon.


That's a part of the gameplay of it:
